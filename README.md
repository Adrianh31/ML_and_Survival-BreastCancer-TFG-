# ML_and_Survival-BreastCancer

This repository contains the steps for making a survival predictor for breast cancer patients using Statistical methods and ML models.

- `Datos-Transformacion` contains the cleaning data process and the creation of different stratifications, the standard clinical ones and others made with unsupervised learning.
- `Datos-analisis`contains the evaluation of the stratifications using statistical methods.
- `Modelos ML` contains the data replication, the overview of performance in survival and classification models using mlr, and finally the exploration of probabilistic classification models using h2o.

*ShinyApp* folder contains the code of an interface made for showing the survival curves (for each posible hormonotherapy treatment) resulting of the parameters given as input.
